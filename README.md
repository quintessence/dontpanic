## Goals for the Guides

The initial goal of the Guides is to create accessible guidance
for people outside of the tech industry and adjacent professions
to learn how to stay safe when using devices connected to the
internet.

To put it another way: "we" know how to use password vaults and ad
blockers, encryption, etc. but do others? And how can we explain
the necessary concepts without diving too deep too early.
