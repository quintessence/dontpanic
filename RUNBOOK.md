### What is "coffee" / "coffeeStat"?

Informal fun metric that indicates the labor that went into a
specific article. The coffeeStat adds by tag and topic, so the
stat is per page / article, and if that is part of the series the
total will be calculated as a result.

Recommend using vaguely "t-shirt sizing" for coffees:

* Small - 1
* Medium - 3
* Large - 5
* XLarge - 8
* XXLarge - 12

Note that, for exaple, a 3 part research series with each article
set as "8 coffees" will show as 8x3 or 24 coffees on the topic tile.
